## About the project

This project, which was mainly developed with **Django** and **SQL**, using concepts involving **Models** and **Migrations**, is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist”.

## Credits

This is one of six projects proposed in CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, a computer science course taught at Harvard University. Some of the code had already been written, in advance, for the students by the course staff team.

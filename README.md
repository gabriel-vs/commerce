# About the project

This project, which was mainly developed with **Django** and **SQL**, using concepts involving **Models** and **Migrations**, is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist”.
